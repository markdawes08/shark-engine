# Architecture contract

Decision date: 2026-10-17. Scope: roadmap assignment 00, Shark v1.
These are accepted implementation decisions, not claims of implemented features.
Platform feasibility remains an explicit assignment 02 gate.

MMORPG amendment, 2026-10-17: the user selected a seamless open world. ADR 0007
and the [versioned execution plan](../roadmap/mmorpg-plan.md) supersede the original
offline-only v1 scope. Earlier records are amended in place where their contracts
conflicted; historical handoffs keep their original evidence. All MMO behavior
remains planned. Original 00-35 IDs are retained with M01-M10 inserted by dependency.

| Record | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| [0001](0001-targets-and-boundaries.md) | C++20 targets, dependency direction, application services, errors and ownership |
| [0002](0002-dependencies.md) | Allowed libraries, binding strategy, pinning and integration ownership |
| [0003](0003-platforms.md) | Separate OS/CPU/GPU release candidates and graphics feasibility evidence |
| [0004](0004-formats-and-identity.md) | Source, cache, cooked and protocol versions; IDs and migrations |
| [0005](0005-simulation-and-rendering.md) | Units, transforms, depth, color, ticks and scene mutation |
| [0006](0006-v1-profile.md) | Exact v1 feature and glTF profile, explicit exclusions |
| [0007](0007-mmorpg-architecture.md) | Seamless world, authority, server boundary, replication, persistence and provisional capacity gates |

The [machine-readable requirements](../coverage/requirements.json) assign
implementation and verification ownership. A later assignment may refine an
implementation detail without weakening its acceptance gate. A change to a public
contract requires an ADR amendment, a compatibility/migration decision, and a
manifest/handoff update. A scope reduction, graphics-stack replacement, or platform
removal requires a concrete decision request to the user with evidence.

Documented release candidates must never be promoted to supported platforms from
CPU compilation alone. Only observed results in the prescribed hardware and
packaging gates can establish that claim.
